# Workshop on make AI API calls
## Getting started 
### 1. Make sure you have Git installed
Here are two sites that can help talk you through the download:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

Check Git is installed by typing `git -v` OR `git --version`

### 2. Clone the repository
#### Option 1: in VS Code
- Open VS Code
- Open the folder you would like to store this project in
- Open up a terminal 
- Paste this in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jaz-spec/AI-API-workshop.git
```
A folder called 'AI-API-workshop' should appear in your folder
- Close you current folder and open 'AI-API-workshop'

---

#### Option 2: in your terminal
- Open your computer terminal
- use `cd` and `ls` commands to navigate to the folder you'd like to store this codebase in
- Paste the following command in your terminal 
```
git clone https://github.com/Jaz-spec/AI-API-workshop.git
```
- `cd` to 'AI-API-workshop'
- write `code .` to open the folder in VS Code

---

### 3. Create a .env file
In the root of your project create a new file and call it `.env`
(root just means that it's not in any other folders)

I will send you the API key for OpenAI to paste into this file
